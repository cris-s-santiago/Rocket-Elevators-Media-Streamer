ðŸš€ Rocket_Elevators_Media_Streamer ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸŽ¯ About Week 10 - The marketing department at Rocket Elevators has long been waiting for the opportunity to do media content placement in the company's elevators. To meet their needs, we implement a content delivery module.

ðŸ“Œ This module:

- Reusable library. (in the 'lib' directory of your information system.)
- Entirely developed with the "red-green-refactor" method
- The TDD is made by using RSpec ( http://rspec.info )
- All the content available and accessible via the getContent method.

ðŸ“Œ Media source:

- Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Joke API: http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random
